# LS-Webdev

Due to some urgent work, I had to go out of station and hence I could not complete the website. I have only been able to complete the html and css part of the code. Also, I have only used placeholders instead of actual text. I highly regret the lack of pre-planning and time management on my behalf. I request you to please excuse this and consider the assignment for evaluation.
